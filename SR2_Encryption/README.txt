Welcome to the SR2 Encryption API Documentation! In this documentation you will find all the tools that you will need to work with your SR2 Encryption API. A few rules to keep in mind.
- All requests must be made over SSL with TLS 1.2 support to help maintain security.
- Your plan will come with a unique URL endpoint along with a unique License ID and License Secret.
- It is extremely important that you keep your License Secret safe and secure. It is what is used to authenticate your requests and to access the encryption keys that we store for you. We do not keep backups of your License Secret in order to maintain the security of your system. So if you lose the License Secret that you are provided you will lose access to your system.
- All data that is sent to the SR2 Encryption Service must be formatted as a Base64 string, a UUID v4 string, or a plain string. Data that is to be encrypted or signed must be a Base64 string.
- If you need a new License ID and License Secret, please don't hesitate to contact us at contact@sr2solutions.com or call us at +1-866-422-1199.
- You may make as many requests as your application needs to, but it will be limited by the number of vCPUs that you purchase as part of your plan. If you think you need to upgrade please contact us at contact@sr2solutions.com or call us at +1-866-422-1199.
 
Your LicenseID and License Secret are never stored by SR2 Solutions or any of our vendors. We take great steps to insure that your information is kept secret so that only those that you authorize will have access to it. Encryption and Decryption of data will be impossible after that. All key data is encrypted at rest in the SR2 Encryption Server using your License Secret, thus preventing access to the key material by the SR2 Solutions team or, more importantly, any hackers that do manage to break in. If at any time you think someone has gained access without your permission please contact us as soon as possible so that the incident can be investigated and resolved as quickly as possible. Contact us at contact@sr2solutions.com or call us at +1-866-422-1199.

If you haven't done so, the first thing you will want to do is create an encryption key with /aes/createkey/. If you want to add additional authentication data that would be required when encrypting and decrypting, be sure to include it in the body as AdditionalAuth. This method will return a KeyId. After you have created a key you can then encrypt any data up to 64KB of Base64 data with the KeyId.

Every project is different, so we leave key rotation to you. To do key management you can deactivate a key which prevents data from being encrypted with that key, but decryption can still be performed. You can also delete a key to securely destroy a key from the SR2 Encryption Service.
