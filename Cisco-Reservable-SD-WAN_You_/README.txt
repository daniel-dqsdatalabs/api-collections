This public repo contains a POSTMAN environment and collection that can be used to interact with the Cisco SD-WAN vManage REST API. The environment is pre-configured to access the Cisco DevNet Reservable Sandbox for SD-WAN fabric. You can edit the variables in the environment to point to your own vManage instance. The collection contains REST API calls to authenticate, get a list of devices that are part of the SD-WAN fabric, and get device status, counters, and interface statistics for all the interfaces in the fabric. Feel free to modify them as you see fit and to add more calls to the collection. To use the Cisco SD-WAN sandbox, and search for SD-WAN sandboxes. https://developer.cisco.com/sandbox
