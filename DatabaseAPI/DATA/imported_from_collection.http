    "theme-of-search": "Food Waste",
    "insight_id": 14,
    "challenge": "Identify specific clusters within food loss& waste (per region) based on actual start-up activity, prioritization based on VC dollars invested, level of start-up activity and the level of maturity/actionability and any other relevant indicators the platform can generate to inform prioritization, structural collaboration areas, where we need to actively promote collaboration to make the whole bigger than the SOTP.",
    "cluster-1-name": "Packaging solutions",
    "cluster-1-description": "Packaging solutions to extend shelf life and reduce risk through mishandling. The category includes for example novel plastic packaging design upstream (e.g. crate liners, plastic crates re-design/re-purpose to reduce bruising), resins/biodegradable coatings to reduce oxidation",
    "cluster-2-name": "Storage solutions",
    "cluster-2-description": "Storage solutions to extend shelf life, extend quality or improve transportation climate. Temperature and humidity regulators, decentralized storage for on-farm preservation",
    "cluster-3-name": "Novel processing solutions",
    "cluster-3-description": "Novel primary/secondary processing solutions to re-purpose surpluses (e.g. due to COVID-19) and/or extend shelf-life. Examples include processing into more durable intermediates (e.g. milk powder), alternative formulations/new product design so food producers can source surpluses, mobile/decentralized processing solutions)",
    "cluster-4-name": "Second-grade processing solutions",
    "cluster-4-description": "As an extension to the previous category, second-grade processing solutions/processing of inedible biomass. Technically also processing, but quite often poses a significant technological challenge since the source material is tougher to convert. Ideally, weâ€™d be interested in applications for food, feed, and/or biochemicals/additives i.e. not biofuel/energy (since relatively low value-add interested in solutions that reduce the need for primary ingredients (e.g. solution that uses secondary for feed production rather than food meant for human consumption)",
    "cluster-5-name": "Logistical Optimization",
    "cluster-5-description": "Logistical Optimization to reduce the time from field to plate and storage times. Improve routing, demand-oriented transportation, fleet optimization, last-mile delivery solutions, inspiration from e-commerce",
    "cluster-6-name": "Predictive Analytics",
    "cluster-6-description": "Predictive Analytics and Risk Management to better predict demand changes and not be affected by major events. Demand forecasting/production planning, pixel farming",
    "cluster-7-name": "Predictive Analytics",
    "cluster-7-description": "Predictive Analytics",
    "cluster-8-name": "B2X marketplaces",
    "cluster-8-description": "B2X marketplaces",
    "cluster-9-name": "Harvest solutions",
    "cluster-9-description": "Solutions during harvest to reduce food loss at the very beginning of the chain. E.g. improve harvesting methods with sensors, connectedness and autonomously. Robotic farming and processing. Improve waste management to use. Minimize risk through pest",
    "cluster-10-name": "Harvest solutions",
    "cluster-10-description": "Solutions during harvest to reduce food loss at the very beginning of the chain. E.g. improve harvesting methods with sensors, connectedness and autonomously. Robotic farming and processing. Improve waste management to use. Minimize risk through pest"
