Cisco SD-WAN solution management component, vManage exposes the REST APIs and vManage UI is API driven which means any action we do on vManage UI would have associated RESTful API call. Using vManage REST APIs, we can export Alarms, Events, Statistics etc. from vManage to any 3rd Party Applications/Tools.

The Cisco SD-WAN REST API is a programmatic interface for controlling, configuring, and monitoring the Cisco SD-WAN devices in an overlay network. You access the REST API through the vManage web server. The API is documented on the vManage host, and you can access the documentation by using your browser to navigate to https://<vmanage-ip-address>/apidocs. 

This POSTMAN environment and collection that can be used to interact with the Cisco SD-WAN powered by Viptela vManage REST API. The environment is pre-configured to access the Cisco DevNet Always On Sandbox for SD-WAN fabric. You can edit the variables in the environment to point to your own vManage instance. The collection contains REST API calls to authenticate, get a list of devices that are part of the SD-WAN fabric, and get device status, counters, and interface statistics for all the interfaces in the fabric. Feel free to modify them as you see fit and to add more calls to the collection.
