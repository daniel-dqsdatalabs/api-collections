// Please consider that if the order is shipped through an integrated shipping company, then we can't update the order status from `ready` to `new`.
// 
// To send the order to a shipping company, you will need to change the order status to **ready** and to send **inventory_address_id** value with your request, it's a must since shipping companies need to know which pickup point to get the package from.
// 
// To get a list of your current inventory addresses along with their ids, please check [inventory addresses API endpoint](https://docs.zid.sa/?version=latest#3eb612af-335a-40be-9c81-9503022dfcda).
