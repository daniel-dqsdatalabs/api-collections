This Postman package serves as a guideline for integrating any type of logistic business application with Transsmart via the API interface, version 2.
The package is not meant to describe how Transsmart operates in the logistics process-chain, but rather assumes the reader to be familiar with the business processes involved on the side of the client or Transsmart.

The complete reference of all requests, responses, data types, enumerators, etc can be found here : https://devdocs.transsmart.com.
That resource also contains a few QuickGuides that can help you get up and running soon.
