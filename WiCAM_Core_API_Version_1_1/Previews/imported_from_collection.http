// ##### While Processing
// While the Servers are generating the preview, this endpoint of the API returns an `HTTP-Statuscode 206 Partial-Content` retry after a short time.
// 
// ##### Process Finished
// As soon as the process finished, the `HTTP-Statuscode` turns into a `200 OK` and the response body will contain the PNG
// 
// ##### 3D Files
// This endpoint also works for 3D files (Containing a single geometry not an assembly). In this case the preview will contain the preview of the 2D unfolded geometry.
// 
// _Note: You have to start the unfolding process first_
