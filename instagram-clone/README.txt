# Overview
Very basic APIs for a instagram-clone. It has all the basic CRUD operations to view the frontend application.

# Authentication
Returns `token` on login response but currently, no authorization happening at the backend. Can be used to only detect if a user is logged in or not.

# Error responses
Will return generic error responses with error and message. Frontend has to assume and handle from the status codes.
