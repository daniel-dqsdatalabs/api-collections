// Because the hosted form is a sandbox to your code, the first step after your code has exited the hosted form is to determine the status of the transaction (PTK), and whether to fetch results.
// 
// 
// Status | Description | Action to take
// --- | --- | ---
// pending | The transaction has not succeeded or failed, potentially aborted | Prompt user whether they want to quit the transaction
// false | The transaction has failed | Continue with another attempt or payment method
// true | The transaction has succeeded | Continue with the Transaction Lookup (fetch) to obtain transaction results
