Welcome
--------------
Welcome to Commvault's Rest APIs. You can explore our APIs in [Postman](https://getpostman.com) using the predefined requests we created.

The current version of this documentation is on SP22. You may switch to any of the last three service packs or LTS Release by changing the settings on top.

Setup
--------------
To get started, [create an environment in Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments), select that environment, and set your environment variables by entering necessary values in the `0 - Setup/Environment Setup` pre-request script ([documentation on pre-request scripts](http://www.getpostman.com/docs/pre_request_scripts)).  Also, Some of our calls might have dependencies. `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` may only work after an item is created with a `POST`.

The same set of APIs can be used for both XML and JSON. If you want to get equivalent JSON for the XML, use our [API](https://api.commvault.com/#fe2fa795-dd7c-4416-857d-75704b52be8c) for conversion.
