Welcome to the SimilarWeb API documentation hub! 
Here you can handy documentation on all of our available endpoints. 

Based on simple REST principles, the SimilarWeb API uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication. 

Our API requires an API Key which you can find in the Account section under [API Management](https://account.similarweb.com/#/api-management2). On the API management page, you can also track your API usage and see your remaining API hits. Each endpoint costs 1 API hit per request, unless specified otherwise.

There is a limitation of 10 API request per second per SimilarWeb account; if 2 API keys belong to the same account, this limitation applies to both keys.
