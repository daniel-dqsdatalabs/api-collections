A collection of various API requests to demonstrate the data visualization feature, created by student developers at Berkeley CodeBase. If you'd like to import any particular visualization separately, they are individually published and linked in the two subfolders below.

<br>

Currently, it contains 3 requests for bar chart, 3 requests for scatter plot, and 3 requests for table. They utilize various public APIs ranging from Spotify to the New York Times to UFO sightings, and are based on the JavaScript D3 visualization framework. 

<br>

Each template is versatility tested and standardized to minimize changes to the code outside of custom data parsing. Feel free to use these as templates for your own visualizations!

Here are some examples of a scatter plot and tree!
