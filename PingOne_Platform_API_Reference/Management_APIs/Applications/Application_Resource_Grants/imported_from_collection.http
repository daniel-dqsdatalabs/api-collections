// The `POST /environments/{environmentId}/applications/{applicationId}/grants` operation creates a new resource access grant for the application specified in the request URL. You must specify the `resource` property ID to create the resource access grant. You can also identify the scopes from the resource being granted. The `scopes` property allows a list of scopes to associate with the resource access grant.

// ::: info
// **Note:** Worker applications (admin apps) that have the `client_credentials` grant type do not support OIDC scopes.
