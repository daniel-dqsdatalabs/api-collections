// This endpoint retrieves the schedule of a given service offered by a specified vendor as a collection of ScheduleSlot objects.  Based on the composition parameter, this data can be “full” detail or an abbreviated “booked” view.  Since the collection size may be significant, full Collections features (i.e., filtering, sort, and paging) are indicated plus some explicit filter criteria.  Sorting should always be oldest to newest start time within any specified criteria.
