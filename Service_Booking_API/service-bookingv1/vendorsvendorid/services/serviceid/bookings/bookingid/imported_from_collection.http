// OPTIONAL:  Only required if implementing features(s):  Change Notification
// This endpoint enables the user to confirm a material change that was reported via a booking change notification (e.g., schedule change, price change, booking confirmed after being on a waitlist, etc.).  The posted object should use the “response” composition; attributes not in this composition must be ignored.  If the user confirms acceptance of the change, the endpoint returns a full and updated Booking object with HTTP 200.  If the user rejects the change, the booking is cancelled and the endpoint returns HTTP 204
