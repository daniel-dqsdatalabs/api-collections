Many buildings offer a range of on-premises or nearby fitness, wellness, or other services to their tenants.  These may include personal services such as eye exams, manicures, haircuts, or flu shots.  Other services may be more group oriented such as yoga, spin classes, or general gym access.  The functionality of this vertical focuses on the ability for tenant users to review the availability of these services and to reserve or “book” them for specific dates and times and manage their previously booked services.
