// Starting a procedure means that you will trigger the start of the signing process for the different stakeholders. Consequently, the procedure will start and you won't be able to edit it anymore. 
// 
// In addition, the default value is `true` and all the other values, except `false`, will also start the procedure.
// 
// Finally, it is also possible to activate archiving service directly on your procedures if your subscription and plan allow it. For more information about archiving you can consult the [dedicated section](https://dev.yousign.com/?version=latest#0b2f0a42-6d9d-4f17-b49d-8ec0b2607921).

// There are 2 kinds of signers. 
// 
// On the one hand, there are the signers who do not have any account at the Yousign application and in this case these participants will be defined by the following information: `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`, `phone`. 
// 
// On the other hand, there are signatories who already have an account on the Yousign application. In this case, it's sufficient to add them via their ID:

// | `refused`    | The participant refused to sign or validate the procedure. This usually means that he does not agree with the content of a document. A rejection message can be added by the participant.          |

// If you **don't want a visual signature on your file**, you must create a `fileObjects` anyway with **no position and the page at 0** => `"page": 0,`. Otherwise, the file will be **NOT SIGNED** (visually) by the member.
// 
// You can add several signature images for the same signer and on the same file (for example on page 2 and also on the page 7 and 12) by simply doing several POST.
