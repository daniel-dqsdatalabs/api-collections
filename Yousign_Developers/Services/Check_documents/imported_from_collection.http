// Yousign performs an automatic verification of the identity document with the following checks:
// 
// - Consistency check of the MRZ. This is the Machine Readable Zone found at the bottom of the identification documents.
// 
// - With a character recognition system, we check that the data read on the front of the part is the same as the data contained in the MRZ.
// 
// - We check that all the visual security elements are well positioned and appear coherent (photo, signature,...).
// 
// - We check that the part is valid.
// Note: For IDs issued between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2014, the additional 5-year period granted by law is taken into account in calculating the expiry date (from the date of issue indicated on the front of the card).
// 
// - Consistency check between the surname and first name of the member present on the identity document.
// 
// - Consistency check between the date of birth of the member present on the identity document and that entered.
// 
// It's important to transfer a colour image for the front of the ID (contains the MRZ).
