// A general endpoint for listing email events such as emails opened, emails replied, and links visited.
// 
// For example, if “email_opened” type is selected, it will return all events that are related to the opened emails. Furthermore, it can be made more specific by selecting the campaign id and whether only the first of such events should be returned. That means, if the "is_first" parameter is set to "True", all subsequent opens will not count.
// 
// Please check all the available examples on the right to see the full functionality.
