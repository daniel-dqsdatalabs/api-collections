// Creditsafe Connect has common search parameters across its countries. However, there are some search parameters that only exist at a local level, and have no relevance in other country searches. To obtain the country specific search parameters, call the following endpoint

// Calling GET /companies/searchcriteria?countries='C1','C2' with multiple countries will return only search parameters that are common between those countries. A ramification of this is that searching in a singular country will offer more search specific criteria.
