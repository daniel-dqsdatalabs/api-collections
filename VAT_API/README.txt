Welcome to the VAT API docs. These docs are hosted by the Postman service, you can select various languages to see the example requests and reponses in your preferred programming language. Where multiple responses can be generated by a particular resource you can select on the right hand side to see the different type of responses a resource might produce.

**Note:- These docs are for the current Version 2 of the VAT API service, if you require the Version 1 docs they can [viewed here](https://vatapi.com/docs/)**

# Endpoints

<img src="https://vatapi.com/assets/images/docs-aws-api-gateway-icon.png" width="80" height="80" alt="Amazon API Gateway Logo"> VAT API is proxied and protected by the [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) service.


We run the following endpoints:-

|Region|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
|EU|https://eu.vatapi.com/v2|Businesses trading within the EU region will benefit from connecting to the EU region endpoint which is located in Amazon's London data centre.|
|Global|https://global.vatapi.com/v2|International businesses selling products or services into the EU region will benefit from connecting to the Global region endpoint which utilises Amazon's global Cloudfront network of edge servers.|

**Enterprise Customers**

For Enterprise accounts with their own endpoint, please [contact support](https://vatapi.com/support) for more information.

# Authentication
Authenticate each api request by passing a valid `x-api-key` header value.

Your API Key can be found in the account dashboard:- https://vatapi.com/login make sure to store your API Key somewhere secure and never share publicly.

# Postman
If you're an existing [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) user you can quickly test VAT API functionality by clicking the 'Run in Postman' button in the top right corner of this page, this will prompt you to import VAT API as a Postman Collection...

The VAT API collection expects two Postman variables to be set:

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|**region**|Determines which API endpoint to connect to. Set to 'eu' or 'global'|
|**x-api-key**|Sets the required API Key header value. Set this to the 'x-api-key' value found in your account dashboard.|

Information on setting up and using Postman variables can be [found here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/variables)

If you haven't used Postman before we highly recommend you install the software as it will save you time testing API functionality before embarking on writing any integration code.

# Rate limit
To prevent VAT API from being overwhelmed requests are rate limited. Sending to many requests may trigger responses with the HTTP status code 429. The limits are dynamic and we reserve the right to adjust them at any time to accomodate customer demand.

# API Conventions
* All responses are in JSON format.
* JSON numbers are bounded to a signed 32-bit integer.
* Query parameters and JSON fields use lower case, with underscores separating words.
* The status of the HTTP response indicates whether the request has succeeded or failed. For convenience the status code is contained in each JSON response.
* If a request is successful the JSON message field defaults to the string 'success' otherwise the message will be descriptive of what may have have caused the error.
 
# Example Response

**400 Bad Request**


	{
		"code": 400,
		"message": "Please send a valid JSON payload in the body of the request."
	}

# Response Codes
|Code|Name|Description|Suggested Action|
|---|---|---|---|
|200|OK|The request has succeeded.|n/a|
|201|Created|The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.|n/a|
|400|Bad Request|The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).|Make sure that your request includes all of the required fields and your data is valid.|
|403|Forbidden|You don't have the needed authorization to make the request.|Make sure you are using a valid API Key and have the necessary `x-api-key` header value set for the request.|
|404|Not Found|The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists.|Check you are requesting a resource that actually exists.|
|429|Too Many Requests|The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.|Reduce the number of requests/minute made to the API and check you are not exceedig the number of requests your subscription plan allows, also check you're not making multiple requests for the same resource/dataset for example you may have inadvertently created a never ending loop.|
|500|Internal Server Error|The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.|The issue maybe temporary, if it persists contact support.|
