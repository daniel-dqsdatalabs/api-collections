The COVID-19 API provides information related with the case of pneumonia associated with the COVID-19 coronavirus.  The data we provide is collected from World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), Chinaâ€™s National Health Commission, and Chinese website DXY which provides regional case estimates faster than the national level reporting organizations.
