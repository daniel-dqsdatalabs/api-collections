By making use of the Postman echo services lets check how to use the csv file in our collection. First Import this collection and then download the csv file from this link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSkoh5sZUCuVuQpXpYDYRI3kydwNrRBhRBKVubhufzmuE8Kd25sbBo4A-d_JqhsmdNUXqWsI8PwwsE8/pub?gid=1182176311&single=true&output=csv).
