// This request pulls the umber of specimens tested for SARS CoV-2 by CDC labs (N=4,524) and U.S. public health laboratories* (N=49,681)†// Number of specimens tested for SARS CoV-2 by CDC labs (N=4,505) and U.S. public health laboratories* (N=40,367)// Note: As of March 12, the dates associated with the specimens tested by CDC Labs have been updated to reflect the date the specimen was received by CDC, instead of when they were collected from the patient. Use of the specimen received date better reflects when specimens became available for testing by the CDC Labs.// // * Reporting public health labs are 49 state public health labs (AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, VA, VT, WA, WI, WV and WY), New York City, USAF, and 12 California Counties.// // † Non-respiratory specimens were excluded. For state public health labs, the date represents the date of sample collection, if available, or the date tested. For CDC labs, the date represents the date specimen was received at CDC. Results reported as of 4:00 pm ET on March 19 were included. All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.// // ‡ As of 14 March 2020, public health laboratories using the CDC assay are no longer required by FDA to submit samples to CDC for confirmation. CDC is maintaining surge capacity while focusing on other support to state public health and on improving options for diagnostics for use in the public health sector.// // § Data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when specimens are accessioned, testing is performed, and results are reported.// // It is up to you to decide what you want to do with the data now that you have it. It will at least store in the environment for future use. Run manually or setup a monitor to execute on a schedule.
