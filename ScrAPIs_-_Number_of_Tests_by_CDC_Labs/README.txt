This is a Postman collection for pulling the number of specimens tested for SARS CoV-2 by CDC labs on [the Center for Disease Contral and Prevention (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html), and then publishes it as an API using Postman.  It is designed to pull the HTML from the CDC web page, and parse the content to pull the number of specimens tested published on the page.

If you have any questions about how this collection works, or how it can be used for pulling other data from web page syou can email [mailto:COVID-19@postman.com](COVID-19@postman.com) or [submit a GitHub issue for the project](https://github.com/postmanlabs/covid-19-apis/issues).
