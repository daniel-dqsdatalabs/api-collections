// This example provisions an individual device. It maps the `device_id=bell002` to the entity URN `urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:002` and gives the
// entity a type `Bell`. The IoT Agent has been informed that the device offers a single `ring` `command` and is listening on 
// `http://context-provider:3001/iot/bell002` using HTTP. `attributes`, `lazy` attributes and `static_attributes` can also be provisioned.
