// This is [the sql](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC/blob/develop/data/migrations/V41__large_aggregates.sql) that creates these calculations.

// 
// This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
// which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.
// 
// The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain
// totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
// is the next year â€” for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.
// 
// For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.
// 
// Parameter `full_election` is replaced by `election_full`. Please use `election_full` instead.
