// This checks to see if the current user is subscribed to a thread. You can also [get a repository subscription](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/activity#get-a-repository-subscription).
// 
// Note that subscriptions are only generated if a user is participating in a conversation--for example, they've replied to the thread, were **@mentioned**, or manually subscribe to a thread.

// If you are watching a repository, you receive notifications for all threads by default. Use this endpoint to ignore future notifications for threads until you comment on the thread or get an **@mention**.
// 
// You can also use this endpoint to subscribe to threads that you are currently not receiving notifications for or to subscribed to threads that you have previously ignored.
// 
// Unsubscribing from a conversation in a repository that you are not watching is functionally equivalent to the [Delete a thread subscription](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/activity#delete-a-thread-subscription) endpoint.

// Mutes all future notifications for a conversation until you comment on the thread or get an **@mention**. If you are watching the repository of the thread, you will still receive notifications. To ignore future notifications for a repository you are watching, use the [Set a thread subscription](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/activity#set-a-thread-subscription) endpoint and set `ignore` to `true`.
