// For some datasets available on the Census Data API, data are stored for multiple points of time in one dataset, rather than across several datasets for individual points of time. When this occurs, we refer to the dataset as a time series dataset.// // You can limit by time in time series datasets by using the predicate &time. Please note that you cannot build a predicate with wildcards (:*) for time in a time series dataset. Note that "+"  is needed for time ranges, such as the time range from 1997 to 2012 (below).  // Examples:// + &time=2015 – restricts the result to include data for 2015// + &time=from+1997+to+2012 – restricts the result to include data from 1997 to 2012// + &time=2015-01 – restricts the result to include data for January, 2015// + &time=2015-Q1 – restricts the result to include data for the first quarter of 2015// + &time=from+2015-01 – restricts the result to include data from January, 2015 to the present// + &time=to+2015-01 – restricts the result to include data up to January, 2015// + &time=from+2015-01+to+2015-06 – restricts the result to include data from January, 2015 to June, 2015// <img width="1738" alt="timeseriesDataHtml" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20145532/92128210-2cdec980-edd0-11ea-98f6-24bb8af2ef9b.png">
