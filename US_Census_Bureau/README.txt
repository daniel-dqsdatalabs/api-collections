This is an OpenAPI spec developed by MTNA for documenting the Census API

### Overivew
Throughout this documentation, you will see the {dataset} path variable. This may be a single value, like `cbp`, but often it may be a combination of slash-separated values, like `pep/int_charage`

The best way to find which dataset parameters you need is to start with a Dataset Discovery request. This will return the catalog of datasets available through the Census API, and all of the relevant information needed to work with them. All of the informational calls you see here (Variables, Geography, and Examples) are available on that page.
