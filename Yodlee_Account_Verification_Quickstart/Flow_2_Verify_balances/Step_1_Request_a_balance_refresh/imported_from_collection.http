// Rather than pull all the information, this step includes a dataset parameter.  This lets the Yodlee API know we're only interested in the data we need for a balance refresh.
// 
// The response will include a `requestId`.  You can optionally use this in the next step to limit the information returned.  Copy/paste the `requestId` field from the response body to your Postman environment.
