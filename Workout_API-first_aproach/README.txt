**The Workout API is not a real API.**

Before you start, note that this documentation is an example of an API-first approach. Use this example as a guide to develop your own APIs.

Workout is the name of an example app that recommends exercises to complete throughout your day. 

The Workout API shows the methods you need to create and view an exercise for app users.
