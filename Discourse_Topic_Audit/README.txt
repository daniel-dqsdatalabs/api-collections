Discourse
==================================

Postman's community has transitioned to [**Discourse**](https://community.getpostman.com)!

Although we can't get to _every_ topic posted, we wanted to flag topics that hadn't received attention, and surface them internally (Slack) so that someone on our team could respond.

We decided to leverage our [Monitoring](https://www.getpostman.com/monitoring) service to run our audit periodically.

<h2>Criteria</h2>
We prioritized topics posted in [*Just Getting Started*](https://community.getpostman.com/c/just-getting-started) and [*Help*](https://community.getpostman.com/c/help). We all know how it feels to be new to a tool or framework, or spend hours scouring the ‘interweb’ for answers to your questions.


Topics that hadn't been responded to within twelve (12) hours of being posted/bumped seemed like a good place to start. We also didn't want to surface topics that may have already been answered by other forum-goers, so that's the last criteria.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Before you can successfully run the monitor, you'll need to update a few of the [Environment Variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables) in the environment template provided.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>**Environment Variable Name**</td>
        <td>**Description**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>discourseForumUrl</code></td>
        <td>The URL to the Discourse forum you'd like to monitor. Ours is [https://community.getpostman.com](https://community.getpostman.com)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>apiKey</code></td>
        <td>This value will need to be generated by a forum Administrator. [See Discourse API documentation for more information]((http://docs.discourse.org/#tag/Admin%2Fpaths%2F~1admin~1users~1%7Bid%7D~1generate_api_key%2Fpost).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>webhook</code></td>
        <td>[A Slack webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Setting up a Monitor</h2>
Once you have all of the necessary environment variables, you'll want to [set up a monitor](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors) so that the collection runs periodically.
