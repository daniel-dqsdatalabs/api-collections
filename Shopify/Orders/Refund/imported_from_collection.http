When you want to create a refund, you should first use the calculate endpoint to generate accurate refund transactions. Specify the line items that are being refunded, their quantity and restock instructions, and whether you intend to refund shipping costs. If the restock instructions can't be met—for example, because you try to return more items than have been fulfilled—then the endpoint returns modified restock instructions. You can then use the response in the body of the request to create the actual refund.</p> <p>The response includes a <code>transactions</code> object with <code>"kind": "suggested_refund"</code>, which must to be changed to <code>"kind" : "refund"</code> for the refund to be accepted.
