<p>The <strong>REST Admin API</strong> lets you build apps and other integrations for the Shopify admin.
If you want to create Shopify-powered storefronts for platforms outside of the Shopify admin, including websites,
mobile apps, and game development engines, then see the
<a href="https://help.shopify.com/api/storefront-api">Storefront API</a> instead.</p>
