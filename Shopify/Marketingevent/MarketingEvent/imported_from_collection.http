// <p>Engagements on marketing events represent customer activity taken on the marketing event before customers reach the shopâ€™s website. Not all types of marketing events will necessarily have engagement, and most types of marketing events will only use a subset of the possible engagement types.</p> <br> <p>Engagements are aggregated on a daily basis. However, the data can be sent more often than once a day if the information is available. If you create an engagement with the same value for <code>occurred_on</code> as an existing engagement, then the new engagement will overwrite the previous one.</p>
