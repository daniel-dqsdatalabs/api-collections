// <p>Create a fulfillment for the specified order and line items.</p> <p>The fulfillment's status depends on the line items in the order: <ul> <li>If the line items in the fulfillment use a manual or custom fulfillment service, then the status of the returned fulfillment will be set immediately.</li> <li>If the line items use an external fulfillment service, then they will be queued for fulfillment and the status will be set to <strong>pending</strong> until the external fulfillment service has been invoked.</li> </ul></p> <br/> <p>A fulfillment might then transition to <strong>open</strong>, which implies it is being processed by the service, before transitioning to <strong>success</strong> when the items have shipped. If you don't specify line item IDs, then all unfulfilled and partially fulfilled line items for the order will be fulfilled. However, if an order is refunded or if any of its individual line items are refunded, then the order can't be fulfilled.</p> <br/> <p>All line items being fulfilled must have the same fulfillment service.</p> <br/> <aside class="note"> <h4>Note</h4> <p>If you are using this endpoint with a Partner development store or a trial store, then you can create no more than 5 new fulfillments per minute.</p> </aside> <h3>About tracking urls</h3> <p>If you're creating a fulfillment for a supported carrier, then you can send the <code>tracking_company</code> and <code>tracking_numbers</code> fields, and Shopify will generate the <code>tracking_url</code> for you. If you're creating a fulfillment for an unsupported carrier (not in the <code>tracking_company</code> list), then send the <code>tracking_company</code>, <code>tracking_numbers</code>, and <code>tracking_urls</code> fields.</p> <br/> <aside class="note"> <h4>Note</h4> <p>If you send an unsupported carrier without a tracking URL, then Shopify will still try to generate a valid tracking URL by using pattern matching on the tracking number.</p> </aside>
