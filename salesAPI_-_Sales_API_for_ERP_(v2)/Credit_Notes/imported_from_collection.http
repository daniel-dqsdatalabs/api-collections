// #### Search Credit Notes in ERP
// *(sapBusinessOne=14/ORIN, totvsProtheus=SF1)*
// 
// This service will allow to search Credit Notes in the ERP.
// 
// The search of Credit Notes allows filtering the ERP by:
// - List Search: by `createdFrom` + `createdTo` {required}; by `branch`, `partnerKey` {optional}
// - Unitary Search: `erpKey` or `orderNum` or `docNum`
// 
// If no field for unitary search (`erpKey` or `orderNum` or `docNum`) is informed in the request, the search for sales invoices is carried out by date of creation from/to (which become mandatory).
// 
// The Credit Notes service will consider Credit Notes with:
// - SAP Business One: ORIN.ObjType = 14
// - TOTVS Protheus: F1_TIPO IN 'D', 'B'
// 
// Comments:
// - `branch`: SAP Business One (ORIN.BPLId), TOTVS Protheus (F1_FILIAL)
// - `partnerKey`: SAP Business One (ORIN.CardCode), TOTVS Protheus (F1_FORNECE+'_'+F1_LOJA)
// - `erpKey`: SAP Business One (ORIN.DocEntry), TOTVS Protheus (F1_SERIE+'_'+F1_DOC)
// - `orderNum`: SAP Business One (ORIN.NumAtCard), TOTVS Protheus (D1_PEDIDO)
// - `docNum`: SAP Business One (ORIN.DocNum), TOTVS Protheus (R_E_C_N_O_)
// - `docStatus`: O = open, C = closed, X = canceled, B = billed, P = paid, R = returned
// 
// Data returned in response: Credit Notes data, partner data, items (+ taxes), totals, payments, taxes
// 
// The response will inform:
// - The number of returned objects in the `count` field
// 
// For list search, the pagination feature in the response will be used, where the following fields are used to control the pagination:
// - `pageSize` = maximum number of records on each page (eg: 100), defined in the API configuration, and informed in the response
// - `pageNum` = desired page, provided in the request, and informed in the response. If “pageNum” not informed = 1, If “pageNum” <=0 = 1, If “pageNum”> ”pageTotal” = last page
// - `pageTotal` = total pages, reported in the response
// - `hasNext` = if there are more pages (true / false), informed in the response
// 
// This service will allow you to search the Credit Notes list in two situations:
// - Full Search: will result in all Credit Notes, according to filters.
// - Incremental Search: will result in all Credit Notes, according to filters, which have been included and/or changed in the main register after a certain date/time provided in the request. In the Incremental Search, the `updatedAt` field of the body request (format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) will be used to determine which exit notes should be returned. This information will be used in conjunction with: [1] SAP Business One: the Creation Date and Update Date fields for the Document record in SAP Business One (ORIN.CreateDate, ORIN.UpdateDate, ORIN.CreateTS, ORIN.UpdateTS), [2] TOTVS Protheus: the F1_USERLGI and F1_USERLGA fields
// 
// For the use of user fields (UDF) created in the table of Credit Notes (SAPB1: ORIN, TOTVS: SF1), the respective registration must be performed in the Custom Table.
