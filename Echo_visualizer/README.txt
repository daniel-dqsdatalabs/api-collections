A single request showing how you can learn to use the Postman Visualizer - by sending the data you want to visualize to the Postman Echo API.

* The [Postman Echo API](https://docs.postman-echo.com/) helps you learn Postman by echoing back whatever you send it.
* This template uses a `POST` request with **raw** `JSON` in the **Body** to send the data you want to visualize.
* Check out the **Body** of the request to access and change the visualization data.
* Open the request **Tests** to see how Postman builds the response data into a visualization. Change it to tweak your chart display!
