This collection is intended to pull historical air quality data by date and location. The Air Quality Systems (AQS) API is provided by the EPA. Here is some information directly from the EPA about it: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html

The examples given in this collection narrow down the air quality in Mendocino County, California. Please replace the state, county, site codes, and dates as needed. 

Please note that there is not always available data for some sites or counties. This doesn't necessarily mean you've made your requests incorrectly, but just that the sensors were either not active or the data was not gathered and available through the API.
