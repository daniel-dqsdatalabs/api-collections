A collection of API requests to demonstrate the data visualization feature through a cross filter, created by student developers at Berkeley CodeBase.

For the full list of visualizer templates we have created, click [here](https://explore.postman.com/templates/4424).

<br>

A cross filter allows us to take any common data visualization (e.g. a histogram or line chart) and provide additional user control over the dataset by selecting portions in one axis to see its corresponding data on other axes. This is especially useful for more complex, multi-dimensional data. Here, we demonstrate it with histograms, although it can be extended to accommodate other quantitative visualizations.
