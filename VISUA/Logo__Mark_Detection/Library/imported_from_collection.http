// This endpoint allows to activate new brand logos for your account by specifying a JSON Object with the list of brand logos to activate.
// 
// To activate a brand you only need to specify its name and the url of its website via the fields `name` and `url` respectively. As VISUA maintains a global library the `name` you supplied might be different from the existing brand name, e.g., _Apple Computers_ vs _Apple_. If you wish to refer to the brand by a different name please use the meta functionality as described below.
// 
// Optionally you can specify example images via the `exampleUrls` field to further define which logo variations you are interested in if they differ from the standard ones.
// 
// All URLs submitted, including the example URLs, need to be accessible otherwise the request will be rejected with status code `400 Bad Request` detailing which URLs could not be accessed.
// 
// The `meta` field is also optional and it is useful when you want to attach custom information such as your internal identifier or a custom property for a specific brand logo. The `meta` information will be included in every detection of the brand. See the [Active Brands Meta](https://docs.visua.com/?version=latest#aba9d64e-1929-4a83-a5af-b44a4e427d63) endpoint for further details. If you wish to refer to the brand by a custom name and have it override the internal name you can specify a `.name` entry in the meta field. 
// 
// Below is an example of a valid JSON Object for this endpoint
// 
// <pre>
// [{
// 	"name": "Apple",
// 	"url": "www.apple.com",
// 	"exampleUrls": [
// 		"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/30/01/3230018d8ec9b5fa969bcad6b3ea2760.jpg"
// 	],
// 	"meta": {
// 		".name": "Apple Computers"
// 	}
// }, {
// 	"name": "Coca Cola",
// 	"url": "www.coca-cola.com",
// 	"meta": {
// 		"keyA": "valueA",
// 		"myCustomBrandName": "cocacola"
// 	}
// }]
// </pre>
// 
// #### Response
// 
// The field `requestHash` contains an unique identifier for your activation request.
// 
// #### Dry Run
// 
// In [Dry Run mode](https://docs.visua.com/#dry-run) the format of your request will be checked and validated with the same methodology as a live request. Hence a status code `200 OK` in _Dry Run_ will ensure the request will yield the same result when executed live. The response format is the same except for the field `requestHash` that will contain an empty string.

// Return the list of brand logos currently associated to your developer key.
// 
// #### Response
// 
// The field `brands` contains a list of every brand logo currently active in your account, each characterized by its id, name and icon.
// 
// Within each brand, the array `logoVersionArray` contains the different variations of the brand logos. Each variation is characterized by an icon URL which is a graphical representation of the logo variation. The field `timeCreated` indicates when the logo variation was added to your library. The field `id` rappresents a unique identifier of the logo version.
// 
// If you have previously defined custom meta tags via [Active Brands Meta](https://docs.visua.com/?version=latest#aba9d64e-1929-4a83-a5af-b44a4e427d63) they will be returned in the key `meta` for each logo variation.
// 
// Every logo variation is accompanied by a [Quality Assurance metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall#Precision) called `precision`. `precision` represents the percentage of true positives within a random sample of detections of the specific logo variation. For most logo variations you can expect `precision` to range between `0.98` and `1`. If Quality Assurance data is not available for a specific logo variation or in case your account is configured with custom settings the field `precision` is `null`.
