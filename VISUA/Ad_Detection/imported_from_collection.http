// Detect how likely an user-submitted image is an Ad.
// 
// The image can be submitted using one of the following methods:
// * _URL:_ the image is accessible via a URL and the URL is supplied as a POST parameter called `mediaUrl`
// * _Base64:_ the image bytes are encoded in [Base64 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) and the resulting string is supplied as a POST parameter called `mediaBase64`
// * _File:_ the image bytes are uploaded as a parameter of type File called `mediaFile`. This requires that the request `Content-Type` is set to [multipart/form-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Form-Data)
// 
// #### Response
// 
// The response consists of a JSON array called `detections` within the `data` section of the response. Each entry of the array is a JSON object corresponding to a detection in the query image.
// 
// The field `confidence` (ranging between 0.5 and 1) represents how likely the media is an Ad.
// 
// We strongly recommend that you store the unique `sessionId` field returned with each response as it references the specific request in our system. This can be used for support queries with our team at <support@visua.com>.
