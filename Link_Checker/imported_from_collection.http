// This request will crawl internal links and check all links for a healthy HTTP status code that is less than 400. 
// 
// **HTML scraping**
// 
// Finding all the links on a page requires scraping HTML. The Postman Sandbox supports **cheerio** as a library for scraping HTML elements. Read more about [using the Postman Sandbox](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox) and other libraries and utilities supported in the pre-request and scripts sections.

// 
// **Building workflows**
// 
// The `setNextRequest()` method accepts a request name or id within the same collection as a parameter. Use this method to establish a workflow sequence and designate which request in the same collection to run next, instead of defaulting to the linear execution. Read more about [building workflows](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/building_workflows).
// 
// In this example, we will continue calling the same request until all links are checked.
