// Get the issue type hierarchy for a next-gen project.
// 
// The issue type hierarchy for a project consists of:
// 
//  *  *Epic* at level 1 (optional).
//  *  One or more issue types at level 0 such as *Story*, *Task*, or *Bug*. Where the issue type *Epic* is defined, these issue types are used to break down the content of an epic.
//  *  *Subtask* at level -1 (optional). This issue type enables level 0 issue types to be broken down into components. Issues based on a level -1 issue type must have a parent issue.
// 
// **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project.
