// ### About notification schemes ###
// 
// A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:
// 
//  *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
//  *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
//     
//      *  `CurrentAssignee`
//      *  `Reporter`
//      *  `CurrentUser`
//      *  `ProjectLead`
//      *  `ComponentLead`
//      *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
//      *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
//      *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
//      *  `EmailAddress`
//      *  `AllWatchers`
//      *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
//      *  `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
// 
// *Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses.*
// 
// **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however the user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.
