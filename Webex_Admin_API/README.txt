Cisco Webex includes administration APIs that allow administrators to perform actions such as provisioning a user and managing devices. 

By automating administration, user management and provisioning can be centralized in an existing tool, rather than using the Webex Control Hub. For example, a partner selling multiple Collaboration tools to customers can use these APIs to enable Webex Teams provisioning through a centralized portal.

## What's possible with Admin APIs?

Currently, administration is focused on User Provisioning. Using these APIs, an admin can:

- Create a user
- Update a user
- View license usage of an organization
- View available roles of an organization
- Manage Hybrid Services licenses and users
