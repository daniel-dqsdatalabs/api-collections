// Under the **Tests** tab, I can use the [pm.* APIs](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference) allowing me access to the response cookies. In this example, let's parse some information from the response, and then save this information as an environment variable so we can access this info in a subsequent request. There's [a bunch of stuff you can do with cookies in Postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference#pmcookies).
@name("Echo capture cookie")
GET "https://postman-echo.com/get"
? "foo1"= "bar1"
? "foo2"= "bar2"


// We can use variables using the double curly braces syntax - like `{{this}}` in the text areas of the request builder. Alternatively, we can use variables under the scripting areas (**Pre-request Script** and **Tests** tabs) using syntax for the [`pm.*` APIs](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference).
@name("Echo cookie")
GET "https://postman-echo.com/get"
? "foo1"= "{{cookies}}"
? "foo2"= "bar2"
