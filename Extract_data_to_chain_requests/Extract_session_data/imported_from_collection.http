// Under the **Tests** tab, I can use the [pm.* APIs](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference) allowing me access to the session data. In this example, let's parse some information from the response, and then save this information as an environment variable so we can access this info in a subsequent request. There's [a bunch of stuff you can do with session data in Postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference#pmresponse).
@name("Cat facts capture session")
GET "https://catfact.ninja/breeds"
? "limit"= "3"


// We can use variables using the double curly braces syntax - like `{{this}}` in the text areas of the request builder. Alternatively, we can use variables under the scripting areas (**Pre-request Script** and **Tests** tabs) using syntax for the [`pm.*` APIs](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference).
@name("Echo session")
GET "https://postman-echo.com/get"
? "foo1"= "{{headers}}"
? "foo2"= "bar2"
