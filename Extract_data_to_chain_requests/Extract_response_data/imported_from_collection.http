// Under the **Tests** tab, I can use the [`pm.*` APIs](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference) allowing me access to the response body. In this example, let's parse some information from the response body, and then save this information as an environment variable so we can access this info in a subsequent request.

@name("Cat facts capture response")
GET "https://catfact.ninja/breeds"
? "limit"= "3"


// We can use variables using the double curly braces syntax - like `{{this}}` in the text areas of the request builder. Alternatively, we can use variables under the scripting areas (**Pre-request Script** and **Tests** tabs) using syntax for the [`pm.*` APIs](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference).

@name("Echo response")
GET "https://postman-echo.com/get"
? "foo1"= "{{breeds}}"
? "foo2"= "bar2"
