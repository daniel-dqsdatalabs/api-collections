**The COVID-19 Rich Data Services API from MTNA offers curated, high-quality data and metadata from statistics and contextual datasets from around the world. The catalog is updated daily and constantly growing.**

Given the critical need for timely access to high quality data around COVID-19, [MTNA](https://mtna.us?utm_source=postman&utm_medium=postmanlabs&utm_campaign=covid_19_apis) is making our Rich Data Service platform publicly and freely available for the publication of primary and contextual COVID-19 related data, to support researchers, data analysts, developers, and public users. 

Rich Data Services (RDS) is an innovative platform for publishing data and metadata for immediate reuse by both computer systems and users. While RDS is slated for release later this year, the urgency of the current situation calls for early access. We complement the platform with our extensive experience with statistical and scientific data to ensure high quality content.

This collection serves as a quick start guide for querying COVID-19 data using RDS. To see the full list of available APIs view the [full RDS documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2220438/SzS5umZ3?version=latest#0e79e455-0ffc-4566-ab19-d9ecbf8b217f) or visit the [RDS COVID-19 website](http://covid19.richdataservices.com?utm_source=postman&utm_medium=postmanlabs&utm_campaign=covid_19_apis).
