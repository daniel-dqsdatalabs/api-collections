Frequently called an advanced REST client, Postman is actually a tool that handles any calls sent over HTTP. This means that you can use Postman to send [SOAP requests](https://blog.getpostman.com/2017/11/18/postman-makes-soap-requests-too/) or GraphQL queries. There are other templates that explain [how to work with SOAP](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1559645/RWgtScW1). This template here contains examples of how you can use Postman to work with GraphQL.

Check out [the collection documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1559645/S1Lu2puC) for screenshots and step-by-step instructions.

Using this template, learn how to:
1. Use a JSON request body
2. Use header `Content-type: application/graphql`
3. Import a graphQL query as a cURL command
4. Use built-in support for GraphQL

> Postman launched [built-in support for GraphQL](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/1669#issuecomment-487569592) in version 7.2.
