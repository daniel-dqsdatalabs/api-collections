// This method allows the developer to validate phone numbers in the E.164 standard and return the country to which they belong.  The data returned will include the line type.  But it is not reliable and cloudwi.re provides it simply as a courtesy.  It is not updated.  If you need accurate line type data use Get Carrier Intel.  
// 
// In most messaging methods, cloudwi.re will run the check before processing your request.  However, the method is published for any additional list scrubbing or country identification you would like to do as a friendly courtesy.  
// 
// You will pass the mobile number in the URL of the request.  There is no charge for this method.  The mobile ID should include the country dialing code.  The + sign is not required.
