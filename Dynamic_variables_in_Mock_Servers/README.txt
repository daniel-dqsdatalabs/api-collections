This collection shows how you can use random data dynamic variables in Postman. These variables are also supported in Mock Servers in Postman.

To give this a try, create a Mock Server from this collection and try out the endpoints. Or, look into the Examples under each request to see how they are used.

For more information on what dynamic variables in Postman are for, and the full list of available variables, see the documentation on [Dynamic Variables](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables#dynamic-variables).
