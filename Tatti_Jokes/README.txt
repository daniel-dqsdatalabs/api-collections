## What's a REST API, anyway?
An API is an *application programming interface* - in short, it’s a function that lets programs talk to each other, transfer data and functionality across the internet in a consistent format.

REST stands for *Representational State Transfer*. This is an architectural pattern that describes how distributed systems can expose a consistent interface. When people use the term ‘REST API, they are generally referring to an API accessed via HTTP protocol at a predefined set of URLs.

These URLs represent various resources - any information or content accessed at that location, which can be returned as JSON, HTML, audio files, or images. Often, resources have one or more methods that can be performed on them over HTTP, like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

Tatti Jokes, for example, provides many separates REST APIs for getting all jokes, some random joke and give Like and Dislike to a particular joke.
