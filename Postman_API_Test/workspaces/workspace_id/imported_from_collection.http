GET "https://{{baseUrl}}/workspaces/:workspace_id"


// This endpoint allows you to update a workspace and update it's association to entities like `collections`, `environments`, `mocks` and `monitors` using their `uid`.
// 
// On successful updation of the workspace, the response returns the workspcae `name` and `id`.
// 
// > Requires <a href="#authentication">API Key</a> as `X-Api-Key` request header or `apikey` URL query parameter.
// 
// **Note** : The endpoint expects you to send the desired state of the workspace in terms of the associated entities so be careful when trying to update these entities.
// 
// For eg. if your workspace has collections A and B, and in the update call, you send C's uid in the collections array, then A and B would be removed from the workspace and C would be added.
