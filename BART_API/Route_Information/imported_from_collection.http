// Route information is sometimes updated with schedule changes as routes are reconfigured. This may affect the name and abbreviation of the route, as well as the number of stations.
// 
// The optional "date" and "sched" parameters should not be used together. If they are, the date will be ignored, and the sched parameter will be used.
// 
// WARNING: the current "color" value is incorrect, it should be a text value (e.g. "ORANGE"). Please use the "hexcolor" value until the color value has been changed.
// 
// The configuration section lists the stations along the route in order from origin to destination.
