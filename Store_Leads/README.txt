The Store Leads API provides access to a database of e-commerce stores.

The Store Leads API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.
