// This method of transfer is intended for international funds movement with bank relationship established previously via _bank relationship_. Depending on the underlying facilitator of funds movement it may be necessary to redirect client to an external site for transaction completion. In such case, `redirectUrl` will be provided via separate notification and/or within response object (requests may take longer to complete or even timeout).
// 
// 
// `direction` in the endpoint is limited to:
// * `deposit` - for all incoming funds
// * `withdraw` - for all outgoing funds
