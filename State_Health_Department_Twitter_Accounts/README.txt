This is collection of twitter accounts for the health departments for state in the US, providing authoritative updates on what is happening in each state when it comes to COVID-19.

Before you can use, you will have to setup your own [Twitter application and configure Postman](https://community.postman.com/t/twitter-api-authorization/9512].

All tweets and accounts pulled are also stored in the environment for the collection, allowing them to be aggregated, downloaded, or published to some other location.
