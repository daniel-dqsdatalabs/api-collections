// Replacing **:API-KEY** with the unique license specific API-Key provided within the **INTEGRATIONS** tab of the PAVE Dashboard will generate a Session ID (case id). 
// A new session id must be generated on the server-side for each inspection case (ie for each vehicle being inspected). We recommend you store the session IDs since they'll be used to identify the final inspection output as well.
// 
// Adding a **redirect_url** in the body's formdata will allow the capture UI to redirect the user back to your site when the inspection is complete.

// Once you have the Session Key generated it can be used to launch the capture UI, which begins the inspection process.
// 
// Replace **:SESSION-ID** with the generated session id belonging to the vehicle to be inspected.
// 
// NOTE: Using the Header `Accept: application/json` will return the line "Inspection Complete: redirect to: redirect_url". Without it, the url redirects to the redirect_url given with the session-id generator.

// Once the inspection is complete, you may view the results in a few different ways:
// 
// 
// You may access them as the full JSON with the following endpoint replacing **:SESSION-ID** with the Session Key associated with this inspection.

// 
// You may also view the results in the PAVE Dashboard by clicking “view results” on the session in question.
