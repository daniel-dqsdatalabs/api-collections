// This example simulates a request coming from the device `humidity001`
// 
// The request to the previously provisioned resource `iot/d` is in UltraLight 2.0 format and identifies the device
// `humidity` and passes a known API key.
// 
// The example as written won't work unless the IoT Agent exists and is listening on the appropriate endpoint (`/iot/d`) to
// process the measure. However this measure is the class of request generated by all Ultralight 2.0. sensors.
