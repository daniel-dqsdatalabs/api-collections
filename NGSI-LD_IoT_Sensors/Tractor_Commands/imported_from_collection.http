// This example shows how a real IoT Agent would send an Ultralight command to a **Tractor** FMIS to move it from an idle
// to an active state. The unit with the **Tractor** itself has already supplied an endpoint `/iot/tractor001` where it is
// listening for commands.
// 
// The body of the request consists of the `id` of the device (`urn:ngsi-ld:Device:tractor001`) as held in the Context
// Broker and the name of the command (`start`) to invoke on the device.
// 
// The response returns the command and the result of the action.
// 
// Once the tractor is activated,  the location and activity of the tractor will alter dependent upon whether the internal GPS
// detects movement. The measurement is actively reported and requests to the IoT Broker can be seen on the device monitor
// page.
// 
// The body of the request consists of the `id` of the device (`urn:ngsi-ld:Lamp:001`)
// as held in the Context Broker and the name of the command (`on`) to invoke on the device.
// 
// The response returns the command and the result of the action.
// 
// Once the lamp is switched the luminocity level will alter dependent upon whether the internal
// motion sensor detects movement. The measurement is actively reported and requests to the
// IoT Broker can be seen on the device monitor page.
