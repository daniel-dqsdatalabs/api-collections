// In addition to sharing API documentation privately, you can also share collections and environments publicly as web-viewable documentation. Documentation is based on a Postman collection, so you can [generate it from an existing collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/#documenting-an-existing-collection) or [create it in conjunction with a new collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/#creating-documentation-for-a-new-collection).// // Here's some examples of good documentation collections:// - **Ping Identity** has a number of public APIs listed on their [Ping Identity team profile page](https://explore.postman.com/263615). In the [PingOne Platform APIs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1848580/T17Q6jdj) collection, endpoints are organized neatly into folders, markdown tables summarize required and optional variables, and technical diagrams provide a general overview for readers.// - **Dropbox** has a single documentation collection with [workflows for team admins](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12072907/T1DjjKE7) listed on their [Dropbox team profile page](https://explore.postman.com/43fWSHmB4AFWXr). This collection is unique in that it’s not intended for API reference, but rather for Dropbox team admins to execute specific workflows and tasks. The collection is kind of like an admin panel or internal tool, executing scripts in Postman.// - **Twitter** has two profile pages for their [Developer Labs](https://explore.postman.com/356847) and [Twitter Ads](https://explore.postman.com/TwitterAdsAPI) teams. For the Twitter API v2, they’ve included examples demonstrating practical scenarios like `429 Rate limit exceeded` and `200 Request Tweet fields`. When you import this collection, you can also see a collection-level script that runs before every request in the collection to retrieve a Bearer token from the client credentials that you provide in your environment file.// - **Rich Data Services** provides a wealth of information with their data APIs, providing all the information you need to [understand what is being offered with their COVID-19 APIs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2220438/SzYevv9u?version=latest). Notice that every API request has a visualization displayed under the **Visualize** tab of the response body that guides you through how to use each individual API.

// The **Run in Postman** button is one way to share a Postman collection (and optional environment). This button is found in the [Postman API Network](https://explore.postman.com/), at the top of published documentation in the web, and also where publishers embed the stand-alone button (like in a README or developer portal).// // Here's examples of these buttons in the wild: // - **[Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/postman-collections/)** has a bevy of collections to showcase their product.// - **[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/api-reference/get-tweets-search-stream)** includes a separate button for each endpoint's API reference, styled to match their iconic Twitter brand.

// When you share API documentation publicly, you can also list those collections in the [Postman API Network](https://explore.postman.com/) for broader discovery. Make sure to add a concise description and tags so users can easily identify relevant APIs.// // If I'm looking for an API that can handle payments, for example, I can search the Postman API Network while I'm working in Postman to kick the tires on the available APIs.// // ![[payment search in the network](https://postman-web-property-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/payment-api-search-network.png)](https://postman-web-property-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/payment-api-search-network.png)

// When you publish a collection, you can do that from either a personal profile or team profile. Taking the time to fill out your team profile gives readers a clear sense of who a collection is published by - helping them to decide whether to try it out or not. You can add a name, description, photo, and custom URL.// // ### Ping Identity Example// // Here's an example of a [team profile page from Ping Identity](https://explore.postman.com/263615) listing multiple collections in the Postman API Network.// // ![[Ping profile page](https://postman-web-property-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/ping-explorer-profile-page.png)](https://postman-web-property-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/ping-explorer-profile-page.png)
