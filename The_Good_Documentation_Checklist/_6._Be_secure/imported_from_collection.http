// Another great use for variables is [to store your secrets](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-use-api-keys/) instead of hard-coding your confidential data. Remember to update your secrets with placeholder text, so you donâ€™t leak any confidential information. // // ### Twitter example// // If you have a Twitter Developer account, go ahead and plug in your Twitter credentials under the **Authorization** tab, and then update `{{myTwitterHandle}}` under the **Params** tab.

// Some publishers have an isolated testing environment called a sandbox. This allows users to play around with the API without incurring any costs or side effects in a production environment. You can show users how to interact with your sandbox by pre-populating a collection and environment with the sandbox domain and test credentials.// // Here's some examples of APIs that provide test credentials for you to explore data in a sandbox without incurring costs or impacting your production database.// - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)// - [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/test-credentials)// - [Yodlee](https://developer.yodlee.com/getting_started_in_sandbox)// // ### Twilio example// // If you have a Twilio account, go ahead and create environment variables `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER` to use in the URL, Authorization tab, and Body. You can use a test number for the `From` phone number, and the test credentials for your `ACCOUNT_SID` and `AUTH_TOKEN`, so that you can exercise parts of the REST API without charging your account.
