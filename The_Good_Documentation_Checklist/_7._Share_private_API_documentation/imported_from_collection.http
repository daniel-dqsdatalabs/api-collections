// Share your API documentation with teammates by sharing the collection to a [team workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/). The default role is that anyone is a “Viewer” of the collection but you can grant “Editor” capabilities to trusted team members. [Fork](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/#forking-a-collection) and then merge the collection so you can choose when to work independently versus collaboratively.
