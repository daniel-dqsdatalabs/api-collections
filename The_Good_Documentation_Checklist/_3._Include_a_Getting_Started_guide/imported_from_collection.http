// The collection description should include relevant information about rate limiting, content types, or settings that apply across endpoints. Any h1 heading that you add to the collection description automatically displays in the side navigation. This makes it easier for the reader to scan for important sections of the documentation. 
// 
// Here's an example linking directly to sections within the [Postman API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/631643/JsLs/).
// 
// - [Authentication](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/631643/JsLs/#authentication)
// - [Rate Limits](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/631643/JsLs/#rate-limits)

// ### Dropbox example
// 
// Here's an [example from Dropbox](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12072907/T1DjjKE7) with headings in the Introduction to explain Authorization using screenshots for more guidance.

// The collection description is also a good place to be explicit about how to authorize requests - including instructions explaining what developers need to do to acquire and use credentials. Additionally, Postman has [auth helpers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/) under the **Authorization** tab to help get users interacting with your API quickly. 
// 
// Some publishers choose to manually add authorization headers under the **Headers** tab of a request, but you can also add an authorization type for an entire folder or collection.
// 
// Take a look at [more examples](https://explore.postman.com/templates/9420/oauth-20) of various OAuth 2.0 flows using Spotify and PagerDuty APIs talked about in [this blog post](https://blog.postman.com/pkce-oauth-how-to/).
