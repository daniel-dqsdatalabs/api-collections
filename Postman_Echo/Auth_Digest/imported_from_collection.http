// Performing a simple `GET` request to this endpoint returns status code `401 Unauthorized` with `WWW-Authenticate` header containing information to successfully authenticate subsequent requests.// The `WWW-Authenticate` header must be processed to extract `realm` and `nonce` values to hash subsequent requests.// // When this request is executed within Postman, the script attached with this request does the hard work of extracting realm and nonce from the header and set it as [global variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments#global-variables?source=echo-collection-app-onboarding) named `echo_digest_nonce` and `echo_digest_realm`.// These variables are re-used in subsequent request for seamless integration of the two requests.
