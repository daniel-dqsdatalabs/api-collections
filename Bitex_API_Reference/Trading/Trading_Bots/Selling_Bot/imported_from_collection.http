// A selling bot is an assistant that puts Sell orders for you. It uses a strategy of dividing the amount and making the orders smaller, to get the best price.
// 
// * `amount`: The amount of __base__ money that you intend to sell for __quote__ money. Both the __quote__ and the __base__ currencies are determined by the Orderbook selected. (e.g. A selling bot with amount = 2 and orderbook = BTC/USD, will sell 2 BTC for as much USD as it can).
// 
// To get all possible `orderbook_code`s check [Orderbooks](#274fb149-0603-4d41-af61-2f1a0f438aec)
