Visualizing the list of all Formula 1 circuits, around the world. This endpoint is picked from the Formula One Collection
(https://explore.postman.com/templates/8955/formula-1-api) to demonstrate the data visualization feature.

The visualization is based on the JavaScript D3 visualization framework. The template is tested and standardized to minimize changes to the code outside of custom data parsing. Feel free to use this as templates for your own visualizations!
