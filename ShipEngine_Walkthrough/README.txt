- Create and download shipping labels
- Calculate shipping costs for any package
- Compare rates across UPS, FedEx, USPS and other carriers

> **NOTE:** This collection includes a [collection variable](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/variables-and-environments/variables/#defining-collection-variables) named `API_KEY`.  Set this variable to [your ShipEngine sandbox key](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/#api-keys) so you can send API requests and see real results right in Postman!
