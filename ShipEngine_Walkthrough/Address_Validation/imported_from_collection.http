// This request demonstrates ShipEngine's ability to validate and fill-in an incomplete address.

Also notice that the incomplete stree address (525 Winchester) is filled-in as well (525 S Winchester Blvd).

// This request demonstrates ShipEngine's ability to automatically correct some addresses. In this case, the `city_locality` and `state_province` do not match the `postal_code`, and ShipEngine is able to determine that the _correct_ values are San Jose, California". We're able to determine this because there is no "525 S Winchester Blvd" in Austin, Texas, but there _is_ one in San Jose, California, which matches the `postal_code`. However, if the street address had been a valid Austin address (such as 4009 Marathon Blvd), then the `postal_code` would have been corrected instead.
