The collection is an example of a testing across-API transactions. 

The collection demonstrates that using multiple requests you may test the transactions of adding a product (for an e-commerce Website), updating the price for the product, checking on if the price has been updated, retrieving multiple products, and deleting a product.

You may use a Postman monitor to continuously test the transations.
