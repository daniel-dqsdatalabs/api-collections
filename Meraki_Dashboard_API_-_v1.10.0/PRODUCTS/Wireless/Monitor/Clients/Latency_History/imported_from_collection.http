// Return the latency history for a client. Clients can be identified by a client key or either the MAC or IP depending on whether the network uses Track-by-IP. The latency data is from a sample of 2% of packets and is grouped into 4 traffic categories: background, best effort, video, voice. Within these categories the sampled packet counters are bucketed by latency in milliseconds.
