// This method adds a new onboarding rule to the Vault that filters discovered local privileged pending accounts. When a discovered pending account matches a rule, it will automatically be onboarded to the Safe that is defined in the rule and the password will be reconciled.
// Note: The Safe and the reconcile account must be created according to the ruleâ€™s definition before you run this API in order to onboard the pending account automatically. The reconcile account must be associated to the platform that is defined in the rule.
