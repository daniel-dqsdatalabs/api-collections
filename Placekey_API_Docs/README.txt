Welcome to the Placekey API Docs. You can use this API to retrieve a [Placekey](https://placekey.io) for any location in the world, identifying it by its geographical coordinates or its address. And if you give us the name of the place, your Placekey will contain a unique identifier for the POI that's located there. If you have any feedback or if you need help, please contact us on [https://placekey.io/feedback](https://placekey.io/feedback).
