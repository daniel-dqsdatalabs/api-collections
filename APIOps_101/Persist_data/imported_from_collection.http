// ## Pre-requisites
// 
// You will need to set values the following variables:
// 
// - `environmentUid`: The unique ID for the current environment. You can get this by switching over to `Browse` mode, clicking on the environment name, and copying the last part of the URL from your web browser.
// - `postmanApiKey`: Your Postman API Key. You can find this from the `Integrations` section in the Postman web dashboard.
