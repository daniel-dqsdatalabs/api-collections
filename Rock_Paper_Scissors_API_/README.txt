# Welcome on Gosia´s first documentation for API.

## Introduction:
This is Rock Paper Scissors - Game API for 2 players or for player vs computer.

## Overview:
I´m a java developer student, so this API isn´t perfekt yet, but works. :)

## Authentication:
You have to use html-page made for API if you want to play the game. 

## Error Codes:
If you want to play PvP game when PvC game is taken or vice versa, you get the info that the game is taken by the other game variant and you must reset the game if you want to play.
