The SimpleKart REST API demonstrates the API Builder capabilities in Postman using an imaginary E-Commerce. It provides endpoints for retrieving items or orders and their details from a database as well as adding order details to a database.

> This API is built on top of a mock server, this means the data is static and can't be edited.

# Getting Started

Make sure that you have the `Prod` environment selected in Postman ([learn more about environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/variables-and-environments/variables/#environments-in-postman)) and you will be able to start sending request to the SimpleKart API.
