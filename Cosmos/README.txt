A sample API that retrieves constellations as an example to demonstrate features in the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

**Get started**: Make sure you have a Postman environment called `cosmos` selected in the Postman app. There should be a key `baseUrl` with the value `https://e8c086f7-a5c9-4752-b81f-bfac0d0dc5d2.mock.pstmn.io`.

This collection was generated from an OpenAPI specification file as described in this blog post about [Bringing law and order to APIs with OpenAPI Specifications](https://medium.com/@joycelin.codes/api-specifications-d87588ac874). Follow along with [this example project](https://github.com/postmanlabs/spectral-postman).
