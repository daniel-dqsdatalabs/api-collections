// # JSONpath Visualizer
// 
// For this example, we'll be using [Randomuser API](https://randomuser.me/api) - This is an API that returns random user data and is perfect for demonstrating the power of JSONpath.
// 
// Once the request has been made and the `response body` has been returned, switch to the Visualize tab to start using the tool.
// 
// You will be presented with an Input Field to start adding your JSONPath expressions to start filtering the data. The queries will be evaluated in _realtime_ and the filtered data will be presented once a valid query has been made.

// 
// As its evaluated in realtime, there will be parsing _errors_, these are expected and will be logged to the *Visualizer* console as info messages. If you also wanted see these as you enter your queries, there is a checkbox available that will display them above the filtered data.

// 
// ## Filtering the response data
// 
// Here are a few _basic_ JSONPath queries that can be used against the Randomuser API:
// 
// - `$..results.length`
// - `$..name.first`
// - `$..results[*].dob`
// 
// The queries above are quite simple but JSONPath gives you the ability to use a number of conditional methods, in the queries, to display the data in a number of different ways.
// 
// | JSONPath Expression  | What's it doing  | 
// |---|---|
// | $..results[?(@.gender == 'female')]  | Gets all the `female` entries in the results array  |
// | $..results[?(@.dob.age <= 35)]  |  Gets any entries that are aged `35` or lower |
// | $..results[?(@.name.title == 'Mr')] |  Gets all the entries with the title _Mr_ |
//

// 
// ### Further jsonpath instructions
// 
// A full list of the commands and expressions that can be used are listed [here](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath#readme).
