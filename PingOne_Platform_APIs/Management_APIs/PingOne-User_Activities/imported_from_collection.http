// #### `filter` Parameter
// Can be set to a [SCIM filtering expression](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) to indicate the audit events to be returned, for example `startDate eq "2018-08-28T10:21:38-05:00" and endDate eq "2019-07-02T13:43:42-05:00" and sampleSize eq "HOUR"`
// 
// The following attributes can be used in filter expressions:
// 
// Attribute | Operators | Notes
// --------- | --------- | -----
// endDate | | A date-time String for the ending date of the data to include (ISO 8601 format). A startDate value must be specified.
// sampleSize | |  One of: `HOUR`, `DAY`, `WEEK`. Determines how the data is sized when returned. The default value is determined based on the date range used. If the date range is less than or equal to 5 days, HOUR is used. If the date range is greater than 5 or less than or equal to 60, DAY is used. If the date range is greater than 60
// startDate | |  A date-time String for the starting date of the data to include, in ISO 8601 format (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ). An endDate value must be specified.
// 
// The following operators are supported in the filter expression:
// 
// Operator | Description
// -------- | -----------
// eq | Equal to. The attribute and operator values must be identical.
// gt | Greater than. This is a chronological comparison.
// ge | Greater than or equal to. This is a chronological comparison.
// lt | Less than. This is a chronological comparison.
// le | Less than or equal to. This is a chronological comparison.
// in | Includes. Matches one or more values.
// sw | Starts with. The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, starting at the beginning of the attribute value.
// ew | Ends with. The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value, matching at the end of the attribute value.
// co | Contains. The entire operator value must be a substring of the attribute value for a match.
// pr | Present. The attribute has a non-empty or non-null value.
// or | Logical OR. Logical OR for building compound expressions if either expression is true.
// and | Logical AND. Logical AND for building compound expressions where both expressions are true.
// not | Logical NOT. Logical NOT for building compound expressions if the expression evaluates to false.
