// Once a dynamic context system is up and running, we need to inform **Cygnus** of changes in context.
// 
// This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the Orion Context Broker.
// 
// * The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to measurements from the attached IoT Sensors
// * The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that Cygnus will be informed of all context data changes.
// * The notification `url` must match the configured `CYGNUS_MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT`
// * The `attrsFormat=legacy` is required since Cygnus currently only accepts notifications in the older NGSI v1 format.
// * The `throttling` value defines the rate that changes are sampled.
// 
// As you can see, the database used to persist context data has no impact on the details of the subscription. It is the same for each database.

// If a subscription has been created, you can check to see if it is firing by making a GET 
// request to the `/v2/subscriptions` endpoint.
// 
// Within the `notification` section of the response, you can see several additional `attributes` which describe the health of the subscription
// 
// If the criteria of the subscription have been met, `timesSent` should be greater than `0`.
// A zero value would indicate that the `subject` of the subscription is incorrect or the subscription 
// has created with the wrong `fiware-service-path` or `fiware-service` header
// 
// The `lastNotification` should be a recent timestamp - if this is not the case, then the devices
// are not regularly sending data. Remember to unlock the **Smart Door** and switch on the **Smart Lamp**
// 
// The `lastSuccess` should match the `lastNotification` date - if this is not the case 
// then **Cygnus** is not receiving the subscription properly. Check that the host name
// and port are correct. 
// 
// Finally, check that the `status` of the subscription is `active` - an expired subscription
// will not fire.
