## Welcome to Testing and Automation training! üïµÔ∏èüîç

__FORK the collection to create a copy in your own workspace.__

This collection will walk you through writing scripts to test your response data in Postman, passing data between requests using variables, validating responses against schema, as well as automating your testing using dynamic faker data and the collection runner, defining control flow, and running collections on the command line with Newman.

This collection uses a mock API with a few demo endpoints that return order data. We will use these endpoints to model a typical workflow so that you can go on to apply what you've learned when you're working with real-world APIs.

Open the first request, check out the docs on the right, and **Send**!
