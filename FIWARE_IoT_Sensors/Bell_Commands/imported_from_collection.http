// This example shows how a real IoT Agent would send commands to an actuator. The **Bell** has supplied an endpoint
// `/iot/bell001` where it is listening for commands.
// 
// The body of the request is in Ultralight syntax and consists of the `id` of the device (`urn:ngsi-ld:Bell:001`)
// as held in the Context Broker and the name of the command (`ring`) to invoke on the device.
// 
// The response returns the command and the result of the action.
// 
// If you are viewing the device monitor page, you can see the state of the bell change.
