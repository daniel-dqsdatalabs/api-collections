Welcome to an interactive documentation of Sagenda free booking system third-party developer API!

After going through the steps, you can use our infrastructure to get a head-start on managing your bookings and control the way you do it.

To get started, you need to:

1. Get a **[Sagenda](https://sagenda.net)** account (if you don't have it already)
2. Set up your account with event patterns and bookable items (optional)
3. Go to **[Account settings](https://sagenda.net/Settings/AccountSettings)** page to get your `Authentication code` and, optionally generate a `Client credentials` pair (for sensitive data endpoints)
4. Acquire an `Authentication code`-based access token for client-facing public web apps. This token allows listing your events, booking them and getting frontend settings.
5. Acquire a `Client credentials`-based access token for server-side request **ONLY**. Exposing this token WILL put your account data at risk of unauthorized access and modification for a duration of an access token

**Don'f forget to check back once in a while, we're constantly adding features and documentation!**
