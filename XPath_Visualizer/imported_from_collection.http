// # Xpath Visualizer// // For this example, we'll be using [HttpBin API](https://httpbin.org/) - This is an API that returns random xml and is perfect for demonstrating the power of Xpath. Additionally, you can filter html with Xpath, and change the endpoint to `/html` to return and filter it. // // Once the request has been made and the `response body` has been returned, switch to the Visualize tab to start using the tool.// // You will be presented with an Input Field to start adding your XPath expressions to start filtering the data. The queries will be evaluated in _realtime_ and the filtered data will be presented once a valid query has been made.// // ![Xpath Visualization Tool](https://i.ibb.co/8b7mTxs/Screen-Shot-2019-12-19-at-10-13-58-PM.png)// // As its evaluated in realtime, there will be parsing _errors_, these are expected and will be logged to the *Visualizer* console as info messages. If you also wanted see these as you enter your queries, there is a checkbox available that will display them above the filtered data.// // ![Xpath Visualization Tool Errors](https://i.ibb.co/Lrm65JX/Screen-Shot-2019-12-19-at-10-15-00-PM.png)// // ---// // ## Filtering the response data// // Here are a few _basic_ XPath queries that can be used against the HttpBin API:// // - `//slide/title`// - `//slide/item`// - `//slide[*]/title`// // The queries above are quite simple but XPath gives you the ability to use a number of conditional methods, in the queries, to display the data in a number of different ways.// // | XPath Expression  | What's it doing  | // |---|---|// | //slide/title[text()="Overview"]  | Gets all the _Overview_ entries in the for the title tag  |// | //slide[@type="all"][1]  |  Gets any slide tags that have _type_ attribute equal to _all_ |// | //em[contains(text(),"Wonder")] |  Gets all the em tags that contain the text _Wonder_ |// // ---// // ### Further xpath instructions// // A list of the commands and expressions that can be used are listed [here](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/8c305ec8c713aad07b14).
