// Adopt a Box.
// 
// To Adopt a Box, you POST a JSON payload with populated with the following fields:
// 
// `macAddress`: the Box mac address.
// 
// `alias`: A mnemonic name for your Box.
// 
// `licenseCode`: *Optional*. The license code for the purchased plan.
// 
// If you have a starter kit with an included subscription, you can leave the field empty, to automatically use the included subscription. If you use a license code, the starter kit plan will not be used.
// 
// If you are readopting a Box previously deleted, the field must not be used.
// 
// If you already redeemed the license code, the field must not be used.
// 
// `activationCode`: *Optional*. If you already redeemed a few license codes, and you have more than one plan available, you need to pick up a plan to use for adoption through this field.
// 
// You can get a list of the available activation codes using the endpoint `/activationCodes`. If all your already loaded  plans are of the same type and duration, you do not need to use the field, one of those will be automatically used.
// 
// Please note that if both `licenseCode` and `activationCode` are present in the payload, `licenseCode` has precedence over `activationCode`.
// 
// `location`: Two letters geographical server location for faster and optimized access. Pick up the location closer to your Box final installation. The allowed values are `us` (North America), `eu` (Europe), `as` (Asia).
// 
// `protocol`: Network protocol. Allowed values are:
// 
// * `tcp443`
// 
// `topologyMode`: Allowed values are:
// 
// * `BRIDGE`: connect to the existing LAN. WAN and LAN ports are both available, configured as an ethernet switch.
// * `ROUTER`: WAN port must be wired to the existing LAN. LAN port can be configured as a separated additional network, with different addressing.
// 
// `routerIpAddress`: Box IP address on LAN side when in `ROUTER` mode. Not used in `BRIDGE` mode.
// 
// `routerNetmask`: Box netmask on LAN side when in `ROUTER` mode. Not used in `BRIDGE` mode.
// 
// `portability`: possible values are:
// 
// * `true`: the Box can be moved between different networks; when rebooting it will self adapt to the new network.
// * `false`: the Box will stop the VPN when moved to a different network.
// 
// In `ROUTER` mode, portability is always `true`.
// 
// `useRemoteDns`: possible values are:
// 
// * `true`: the DNS used by the Box is pushed to the VPN clients
// * `false`: the client will use the usual DNS servers.
// 
// In `ROUTER` mode, the setting is always `false`.
// 
// If successful, returned HTTP status code is 202 (Accepted).
