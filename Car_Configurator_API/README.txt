The Car Configurator API offers access to the Mercedes-Benz car configuration functions. It provides required reference data such as the masterdata of all Mercedes-Benz vehicles as well as functions to retrieve initial and changed configurations. In addition to that is is possible to save a newly created configuration so that it can be easily restored or shared with others.
